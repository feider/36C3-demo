# 36C3 Deep Learning Demo

Just a small MNIST dataset demo for a talk on Deep Learning. Needs keras installed. You can play around with the network created in train.py and see what works best!

Usage:
* `python train.py` to create an untrained model
* `python train.py run` to create a trained model
* `python test.py MODEL_NAME` to test a model

Have fun!
